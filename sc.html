    <h1>Manideep Nellipalli – Science Writing Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m an undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Vel Tech University. I’m passionate about making science and technology easy to understand for everyone. Below are a few writing samples that demonstrate my interest in science communication.</p>

      <h2>1. Understanding Brain Tumor Classification using AI</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a doctor needing to quickly detect if someone has a brain tumor. My project uses a smart computer system that looks at brain scans and can spot different types of tumors like glioma or meningioma. It’s like training a dog to recognize scents—but here, the computer learns to "see" patterns in medical images. By using advanced tools called deep learning models, we helped the system become really good at this task. This can save doctors time and help patients get diagnosed and treated faster.

      <h2>2. Why Safe AI Matters: A Look into Responsible Systems</h2>
      <p>
        AI is everywhere—from self-driving cars to medical diagnostics. But what if the AI system makes a bad decision? That’s where responsible and safe AI comes in. It’s all about making sure these systems are fair, explainable, and don’t cause harm. In a recent course, I learned how developers must build AI with ethics in mind—just like safety checks in an airplane. A safe AI system needs to be tested thoroughly and be able to explain why it makes decisions, especially in critical areas like healthcare and law.

      <h2>3. Inspired by Nature: The Engineering Behind Bee Drones</h2>
      <p>
        Nature has always been a source of inspiration for science. One cool example is how engineers are designing drones that mimic bees. These flying robots are small, light, and incredibly agile—just like their insect counterparts. Scientists study how bees stabilize themselves and communicate through patterns to build smarter drones for search-and-rescue missions. This field, called bio-inspired engineering, shows us how looking at nature’s designs can lead to better technology.
